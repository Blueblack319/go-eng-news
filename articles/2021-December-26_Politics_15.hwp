Lee, Yoon run neck-and-neck in latest poll amid family-related controversies	Published : Dec 22, 2021 - 10:32 Updated : Dec 22, 2021 - 10:32
Ruling party presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung and his main opposition rival Yoon Suk-yeol are still running neck-and-neck, a survey showed Wednesday, after they apologized for controversies related to their family members.A Realmeter poll of 1,027 people, which was conducted on Monday and Tuesday, put Yoon ahead with 40.1 percent against Lee's 37 percent. The gap was within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.The Realmeter poll was the first survey conducted after both Yoon and Lee apologized for alleged wrongdoings related to their family members.Last week, Lee apologized for his son's gambling. Yoon also apologized over allegations his wife falsified her credentials when applying for jobs.In the poll, both Lee and Yoon saw their support ratings drop 0.1 and 5.2 percentage points.Asked whether the respondents could change their support for the two presidential candidates in the wake of the family-related controversies, 70.7 percent said they will not change their support.In comparison, 16.1 percent responded that they could change their support and 8.9 percent said they already changed their support.Meanwhile, Ahn Cheol-soo, the presidential candidate of the minor opposition People's Party, came in third with 4.2 percent, followed by Sim Sang-jeung of the minor progressive Justice Party at 3.6 percent in the Realmeter survey. (Yonhap)Feminist waging vendetta against Lee Jun-seok by joining Yoon’s team: friend	Published : Dec 23, 2021 - 16:12 Updated : Dec 23, 2021 - 16:12
In a surprise move earlier this week, feminist politician Shin Ji-ye crossed party lines and joined the presidential campaign of conservative People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol. A long-time friend believes Shin’s move is driven by a personal vendetta. “I think she’s doing this to get back at (leader of People Power Party) Lee Jun-seok. My view is that she wants to get back at Lee for lambasting her, making fun of her on national TV,” American Green Party member Austin Bashore told The Korea Herald.Lee and Shin clashed on issues such as gender conflict during a TV debate earlier this year. Lee, who became the youngest leader in the history of the main opposition party earlier this year, is known for speaking out against feminism and is popular among young men who consider themselves to be anti-feminists. “We did talk about Lee Jun-seok and Yoon Suk-yeol and their strange relationship. I feel like Yoon could have contacted her to pretty much finish off Lee from the People Power Party,” he said.Bashore met Shin as a member of the Green Party of the United States. He claims the two have been friends for over five years now.“When I came to Korea, they needed a liaison between the Asia-Pacific Green Parties of Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the US. That put me in a close link with the Green Party of Korea,” he said.Having worked on international solidary projects and issues surrounding the deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in Korea, the two became close friends, he explained.“I don’t know why she did it because I just met her two weeks ago. I just went over to her house for a friendship brunch and as friends we discussed politics.“We discussed all the different candidates. We joked about supporting Huh Kyung-young. We talked seriously about Sim Sang-jung.”Bashore added that he shared his concerns to Shin about how Yoon would be a terrible candidate for workers and minorities in Korea.“I’m extremely disappointed. I feel as if my friend had just died.“All of her co-workers were blindsided -- all the Green Party members were like, ‘What is going on?’ She told nobody.”By Yim Hyun-su (hyunsu@heraldcorp.com)Govt. to cut credit card processing fees for small merchants	Published : Dec 23, 2021 - 11:47 Updated : Dec 23, 2021 - 11:47
The government will cut credit card processing fees for small merchants to ease their burdens amid the COVID-19 crisis, the ruling Democratic Party said Thursday following its meeting with financial authorities. The commission rate for small merchants with an annual revenue of below 300 million won ($252,550) will be lowered from 0.8 percent to 0.5 percent, according to Rep. Kim Byung-wook of the DP. For small business operators with an annual revenue between 300 million won and 500 million won, the rate will go down from 1.3 percent to 1.1 percent, while the rate for those in the 500 million-won to 1 billion-won revenue bracket will be reduced from 1.4 percent to 1.25 percent. The DP said the cut would affect 96 percent of credit card affiliated shops in the country and reduce their card transaction handling fees by about 470 billion won in total. (Yonhap)[Election 2022] Fatigue grows in the presidential election riddled with scandals	Published : Dec 23, 2021 - 16:59 Updated : Dec 23, 2021 - 18:21
The race to decide the country’s next president is becoming a contest of scandals and accusations surrounding the candidates. The political tit-for-tat following controversies have drowned out discussions on policy and state affairs, and voters are having second thoughts on who they should choose in the presidential election, slated for March. “Since the presidential candidates from the major parties have been decided, fresh allegations of past wrongdoings of the candidates and their families are breaking daily,” a man surnamed Lee, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Korea Herald on Thursday. “Now, I am so disappointed by how unlawful the candidates are, and how they are handling the accusations. I have no trust in any of the candidates anymore and I am lost on who to choose.”While the election is less than three months away, some are also expressing wishes for the parties to change their candidates, as the two-way race between Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea and Yoon Suk-yeol of the main opposition People Power Party appears to revolve only around controversies related to their families.According to a survey by local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, 1 out of 4 respondents said they have either already changed their choice of who to support, or are considering doing so due to the family issues. In the poll commissioned by YTN conducted Monday and Tuesday, 16.1 percent of 1,027 respondents said they may change the candidate they support, as 8.9 percent said they have already changed their preference.While the remaining 70.7 percent of respondents said they are maintaining their support for their first choice, they appear to be less than satisfied, as another questionnaire in the poll showed that over half of respondents view the apologies from the candidates over family controversies to be “not enough.”“Obviously we should be choosing a person who would be the best to lead the country. It is a sad reality that we have to choose the lesser evil,” Hwangbo, 30, told The Korea Herald. As she is considering voting for the conservative main opposition party, Hwangbo said she would want the candidate from the People Power Party to be changed to someone else, such as Hong Joon-pyo, who was the runner-up in the party’s primary. “It upsets me to think that I might have to give my ballot to Lee Jae-myung because I am so disappointed in Yoon Suk-yeol,” she added. Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate from the ruling Democratic Party, has been plagued by a series of scandals related to his family.Last week, Lee apologized after allegations were brought forward that his 29-year-old son had engaged in illegal gambling from January 2019 to July 2020 via online poker. He also denied allegations his elder son visited a massage parlor for sex. Lee has also been taking flak for downplaying a case involving his nephew, who brutally killed two women in 2006. As an attorney, he provided the legal defense for his nephew and referred to mental illness in his defense.Apart from his family, the ruling party candidate is also accused of unlawfully favoring his aides in a land development project that is currently being investigated by prosecutors for corruption.The main opposition party has raised suspicions that Lee is the mastermind behind the Daejang-dong development scandal, as he was the mayor of Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, at the time the project was carried out, and that he has close ties with key figures of the project. Over the past weeks, two key officials who were managers of the project at the land development company have taken their own lives, after the probe kicked off. Lee’s rival, Yoon Suk-yeol from the main opposition People Power Party, is also not free from controversies surrounding his family. On Thursday, Yoon’s mother-in-law, surnamed Choi, was sentenced to one year in prison for forging a financial document used in a past deal for a land purchase. According to Uijeongbu Regional District Court in Gyeonggi Province, Choi created a fake bank account balance certificate that showed she had a deposit of 34.7 billion won ($29.2 million) and used it to buy a plot of land in Seongnam in 2013. Choi was also released on bail in September in a separate case, in which she was convicted of establishing a medical foundation and a long-term care hospital for seniors despite having no medical qualification. Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon-hee, has been under attack for weeks for allegedly falsifying her credentials when applying for teaching jobs and for academic plagiarism.Kim, who is the head of a cultural content company, is also mired in allegations of stock price manipulation related to used car dealer Deutsch Motors.While mounting controversies concerning the presidential candidates are creating fatigue among voters, it is not possible to change candidates unless they step down, Shin Yul, a politics professor at Myongji University, told The Korea Herald. “There are no regulations or precedent, and it would create great confusion when the election is just a couple of months away.”By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)How special pardon for ex-President Park may affect March election	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:42 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:44
With just 75 days before the presidential election, the government’s decision to grant special pardon to former President Park Geun-hye on Friday has risen as a factor that may sway the results of the election.While the main opposition People Power Party welcomed the pardon of their former leader, key party members criticized President Moon Jae-in for making a “political move” to create a divide in the conservative bloc, ahead of the presidential election slated for March. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea appears to be concerned that Moon’s decision to grant pardon to his predecessor, who was taken down for power abuse and corruption, would disappoint its supporters.For the People Power Party, which has chosen former Prosecutor General Yoon Suk-yeol as its flagbearer for the presidential election in March, Park’s stance toward the candidate would be a critical factor that would either pull together support or divide the party. For one, Yoon was the lead prosecutor investigating the massive corruption scandal which ultimately brought down Park and eventually landed her in prison in 2017, after she was impeached in the year before. In 2013, Yoon had also conducted investigations into allegations that the National Intelligence Service, the country’s spy agency, sought to influence public opinion to run in favor of Park ahead of the December 2012 presidential election. Raising ire of the Park administration, Yoon was demoted after revealing that he also received outside pressure to water down the probe. With the series of events between Yoon and Park in the backdrop, Park’s pardon may be able to influence the opinions of supporters for the conservative party who could seek to fix the blame on Yoon for Park’s fall. After the announcement, Yoon said he welcomes the special pardon for Park, and also wished for her fast recovery in health. Yoon also said it was not his decision to turn down Park’s request for suspension of execution, which was made twice in 2019, as she cited poor health conditions. Yoon was the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office, and then prosecutor general when a prosecution panel reviewed Park’s requests. At the same time, the president’s decision may also come as a burden for the ruling Democratic Party which came into power from the fall of the Park administration. Moon garnered a landslide victory in the 2017 presidential election following the impeachment of Park, who came in at the center of the massive corruption scandal that brought tens of thousands of people to the streets. The liberal bloc had also gained great support then, making pledges that their administration would be completely different from the corrupt government under Park. Lee Jae-myung, the ruling party’s presidential candidate said he “respects” Moon’s decision. Just a couple of days ago, Lee had opposed granting special pardons for former presidents of the conservative blocs, saying it is “too early,” and that the former leaders should make sincere apologies for their wrongdoings. The presidential office rejected claims that Moon’s decision to grant amnesty to Park is politically aimed. “We don’t know which side (of the political parties) would benefit (from Park’s pardon). But I am sure the government did not consider the presidential election,” an official from the presidential office said. “If the government were to consider the political implications, wouldn’t there have been better times to do it?” the official said, adding that the president did ask the ruling party in making Friday’s decision. The official also said the exclusion of Lee Myung-bak in the special pardon list is because “the cases (of Park and Lee) are different.”Park, who served as the president from 2013-17, is currently serving a 22-year prison term for charges including abuse of power and bribery. Her predecessor Lee is serving a 17-year sentence for similar charges.According to a Gallup Korea poll last month, 44 percent of respondents agreed to granting amnesty to the two former presidents, while 48 percent opposed it.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)Former leftist lawmaker Lee Seok-ki paroled	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:10 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:11
Lee Seok-ki, a former left-wing lawmaker who was imprisoned for plotting a rebellion against the South Korean government in case of a war with North Korea, was released on parole Friday.Lee was released from a detention center in Daejeon with an ankle bracelet that allows officers to monitor offenders on parole. Previously, Lee refused to wear the ankle bracelet. Upon his release, Lee criticized the government’s announcement that came earlier in the day, which granted a special pardon to former President Park Geun-hye. Lee was indicted in September 2013, during the Park’s administration, on charges of conspiring with a clandestine organization to overthrow the government if a war broke out in the Korean Peninsula. In 2014, Lee was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but a high court remitted the term to nine years. Lee was also given an additional eight-month prison term for embezzling hundreds of million won for his campaigns for a municipal election in 2010 and a gubernatorial election in 2011. Meanwhile, the main opposition People Power Party strongly criticized the decision to grant parole to Lee.Won Il-hee, a spokesperson at the election committee of the People Power Party, criticized the Moon Jae-in administration’s decision, saying it is directly against the ruling made by the country’s judiciary.By Shim Woo-hyun (ws@heraldcorp.com)Ex-President Park expresses gratitude for pardon: Park's lawyer	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 13:17 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 13:17
Ex-President Park Geun-hye expressed gratitude for her pardon to President Moon Jae-in shortly after the announcement of Moon's decision to grant a special pardon to her, her lawyer said Friday.President Moon Jae-in said earlier in the day that he granted a special pardon to former President Park, currently serving a 22-year prison term for corruption, to bolster national unity and in consideration of her deteriorating health.In a meeting with reporters in front of Seoul Samsung Hospital where she has been hospitalized, lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha said that Park feels sorry for worrying people and is grateful for their constant support.Park also expressed gratitude to Moon for his decision to grant a special pardon to her despite difficulties, saying she will focus on treating her disease and will show her gratitude to the people as soon as possible, Yoo added.Moon also decided to pardon and exonerate former Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook because there is "desperate need for national unity and humble inclusiveness," presidential spokesperson Park Kyung-mee told reporters earlier in the day. (Yonhap)[Newsmaker] Yoon’s visit to DMZ draws accusations of armistice violations	Published : Dec 23, 2021 - 15:20 Updated : Dec 23, 2021 - 17:21
South Korean presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol’s visit to a front-line division in the Demilitarized Zone has come under fire, with the United Nations Command officially kicking off an investigation into an alleged violation of the Armistice Agreement.The UNC made an announcement after Yoon -- dressed in a military uniform -- on Monday visited the observation post of the South Korean Army’s 3rd Infantry Division, also known as the Baekgol Unit, in the DMZ. In what appears to be a rare move, the UNC publicly said it had begun an investigation into unauthorized activities taking place at OP 241 Baekgol. The UNC did not specify the names of people under investigation in the statement, which was originally issued Tuesday and disclosed to the public Wednesday. The UNC had taken the statement down from the official website as of Thursday noon, without further explanation.“The UNC Commander has initiated an investigation into the incident to determine the root cause of failure and ensure there is neither a repetition of actions that undermine compliance with the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement nor actions that put civilians under greater risk than is absolutely necessary,” the statement read. The UNC listed several acts as noncompliance of the Armistice Agreement, including the use of military attire and authorizing additional personnel into the DMZ without the UNC’s approval.In the statement, the UNC also took issue with Yoon and other visitors being allowed “access outside of specially designated and controlled areas designed to minimize the potential for threats to civilians.” The UNC said it would take actions “as appropriate under the Armistice and standing agreements” with the South Korean government.Some facilities at the Baekgol Unit are located within the areas controlled by the UNC, which extends 2 kilometers outward of the Military Demarcation Line.The main mission of the UNC is to maintain and enforce the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement. The UNC is responsible for investigating the violation of armistice rules, but the UNC does not disclose all the cases under scrutiny in general. In response, Yoon’s presidential campaign said his visit to the observation post was conducted with the permission of the Ministry of National Defense. Yoon’s camp added that the candidate donned the military uniform under the guidance of the Baekgol Unit.South Korea’s Defense Ministry on Thursday said the military is looking into the case and added that it would consult with the UNC over several issues, including the outfit of civilians during their visit to the DMZ. This is not the first time that a politician’s visit to the DMZ has caused trouble. South Korea’s Defense Ministry previously sent an official letter to political parties to ask them to refrain from visiting military units in the runup to the 2017 presidential election. The ministry reportedly sent the letter in a bid to maintain political neutrality and to avoid adding any unnecessary burden on soldiers.Critics said although the presidential candidates’ visits to military units are symbolic in nature, they do send a political message. Political commentator Rhee Jong-hoon said South Korean presidential candidates’ visits to military units are more of a “compulsory course” in light of the significance of security issues on the Korean Peninsula. “Their visit will not draw more public attention. But they will face inevitable public criticism if they do not visit troops.” Eom Gyeong-yeong, director of the Zeitgeist Institute, said presidential candidates have sent a “strong message” to the public and demonstrated their emphasis on national security issues by visiting military units. Considering the inclination of conservative voters to put priority on national security policy, the presidential candidate of an opposition party would see the usefulness of the visit. “A visit is intended to rally conservative voters,” Eom said. “But on the other hand, presidential candidates visit (military units) habitually, rather than being based on political considerations and calculations.” Others said South Korean military authorities should stop indiscreetly allowing politicians and presidential candidates to visit front-line units in the DMZ in what they said repeatedly violates and undermines the Armistice Agreement.South Korea’s Defense Minister Suh Wook this month underscored the importance of “strictly maintaining political neutrality” during the meeting of top commanders from the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

Ruling party presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung pledged Wednesday to complete the country's first moon landing project by 2030 if elected in the March presidential poll.The Democratic Party (DP) nominee also said he will establish a new position of deputy prime minister for science, technology and innovation to oversee planning and budget issues in the science industry.The plans, which were unveiled during a press conference at the DP headquarters, are part of Lee's top seven campaign pledges for the science and technology sector."I will turn South Korea into a top 5 global science power alongside the United States, the European Union, China and Japan," the candidate said.The DP previously said it is looking into a pledge to land an unmanned probe on the moon by 2030.Lee's other pledges include establishing technological sovereignty by developing future national strategic technologies, and expanding research into technologies that will help resolve social issues. (Yonhap)Lee pledges to build nuclear submarines, launch space command	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:06 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:09
South Korean presidential hopeful Lee Jae-myung on Friday promised to push forward with plans to build a nuclear-powered submarine and launch a space command against multifaceted threats as part of his policy manifesto. The presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea announced his envisioned defense and security policies at a news conference, under the theme of “fostering a smart, powerful force.”Lee called for a new, multidomain approach to protecting national security against diverse and non-traditional threats. “We now need to find a new direction in national security against new emerging threats and a demographic cliff,” Lee said. “We should thoroughly examine and prepare for threats stemming from (security) uncertainties and protect the people and the territory of the Republic of Korea with rapid defense innovation and change.”The key of his election pledges is to build the “smart, powerful force” optimized for a new battlefield environment by utilizing the advanced technology of the “4th Industrial Revolution.“To that end, Lee promised to advance the weapons system and “strengthen the core military capability to respond to nuclear and weapons of mass destruction WMD threats.” Lee notably raised the need to establish a nuclear-powered attack submarine, which also has been pursued by the Moon Jae-in government. “I will secure the core military capability for preparing for the future war,” Lee said. “Based on the solid South Korea-US alliance, I will push ahead with building a nuclear-powered submarine, which is capable of ambushing, monitoring, and reconnoitering underwater for a long time, against North Korean nuclear threats.” The presidential hopeful also unveiled its plan to expand a military operations area into space by establishing a “space command” and “defense space network” consisting of early-warning satellites and micro surveillance and reconnaissance satellites.Hybrid of conscription and all-volunteer militaryAnother key pledge is to restructure military service and expand the professional volunteer service, with the goal of fostering more capable and specialized personnel in preparation for the demographic cliff in South Korea.Lee essentially said he would introduce a new hybrid system for military personnel, between a conscription and an all-volunteer military system, seeking a midpoint between the two. But the presidential candidate elucidated he would basically adhere to the current mandatory military service.In the new system, South Korean citizens who are subject to mandatory military service would have two options: Signing up as a conscript and serving as a professional non-commissioned officer. The non-commissioned officers will be assigned to duties requiring combat skills and specialty, which include operating high-tech military equipment. If he is elected as president, Lee said he would reduce the number of conscripts from 300,000 to 150,000 during his term. The ruling party’s presidential candidate, instead, will increase the number of professional non-commissioned officers by 50,000 through conscription and additionally hire 50,000 civilian employees with expertise in administration, logistics, and education to support the military.Lee aims to maintain a standing force of 400,000 personnel after restructuring the military, pushing forward his plans to improve the environment for military service. The plans include the renovation of barracks, an upgrade in the quality of meals for military service, and support for education. The ruling party’s presidential candidate also promised to raise the salary of conscripted soldiers to the level of the minimum wage and pay around 2 million won ($1,700). Lee said he would directly take the initiative in “defense innovation” by establishing a presidential committee. By Ji Da-gyum (dagyumji@heraldcorp.com)[Newsmaker] Parties offer mixed reactions on Park's pardon	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:07 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 17:15
A special pardon for Park Geun-hye, the former president serving a 22-year prison term for corruption, has sparked a wide range of responses in South Korea’s political circles. The ruling Democratic Party appeared largely to respect the president’s decision, while lawmakers from the opposition parties voiced different opinions, mostly raising doubts about the special pardon. Democratic Party Chairman Song Young-gil announced that the party “honors” the president’s decision, which comes from “a constitutional right of the president.”When asked if Song had met the president to discuss matters related to the special pardon, Song said he had not. Ruling party presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung, who has been strongly against the pardon of Park, also said he respects the president’s decision. But, Lee also demanded Park to make another apology to her country on her release. Politicians and presidential candidates from the opposition parties, however, showed rather different opinions.Ahn Cheol-soo, the presidential candidate of the minor opposition People‘s Party said the pardon for the former president was an apparent attempt to compensate for the pardon of Han Myeong-sook, former prime minister during the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration, and the parole of Lee Seok-ki, a former left-wing lawmaker convicted of instigating a rebellion to overthrow the South Korean government.The People Power Party presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, on the other hand, dismissed an argument that the special pardon for Park was a trade-off with exoneration of Han. Yoon also said he “welcomes” the special pardon. Other politicians spoke of potential consequences and impacts that the special pardon will have in the future, particularly in the upcoming presidential election in March. Hong Joon-pyo, a five-term lawmaker of the main opposition People Power Party, however, criticized the current administration’s decision to pardon Park, calling it a “political scheme.” Hong argued that the decision to pardon only Park -- but not her predecessor Lee Myung-bak -- could divide and escalate tensions between pro-Park and pro-Lee factions in the major opposition party.Kim Jae-won, a member of the People Power Party’s supreme council and a key member of a faction loyal to Park, also asked for complete amnesty and reinstatement of not just Park but also her predecessor Lee, who is also imprisoned on corruption charges.Meanwhile, Cho Won-jin, a minor conservative presidential candidate and former pro-Park lawmaker said, Park is expected to make no comment on the upcoming presidential election, particularly about the People Power Party presidential candidate Yoon. Yoon, then a prosecutor, had a key role in undermining the legitimacy of the previous conservative government, as well as exposing its corruption, leading to her impeachment and imprisonment.By Shim Woo-hyun (ws@heraldcorp.com)Moon to hold luncheon with chiefs of conglomerates	Published : Dec 24, 2021 - 21:02 Updated : Dec 24, 2021 - 21:02

(Yonhap)Kim to take stronger lead in conservative election committee	Published : Dec 22, 2021 - 15:08 Updated : Dec 22, 2021 - 18:16
Veteran electioneer Kim Chong-in is once again taking a central role in the presidential election, following yet another power struggle within the People Power Party. Less than three weeks after the party’s Chairman Lee Jun-seok and presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol settled their differences, chaos has struck again with Lee resigning from the election committee following an argument with the committee campaign’s communications chief, Rep. Cho Su-jin.On Wednesday, Kim held a press conference at the National Assembly, underlining that Lee would not return to the committee. “Lee made an announcement and we have to accept it,” Kim said. “The conflict between Lee and Cho should be wrapped up. We will have to work on increasing the efficiency of the committee.”When questioned on whether the fallout of Lee, who is supported by younger voters, would affect the party, Kim said a presidential election campaign is led by the candidate. “A presidential candidate decides on the direction, then all generations could agree to follow. It is not about specific age groups supporting a specific person,” Kim said.Prior to the conference, Kim met with Lee for a prearranged luncheon. Lee said the two did not discuss his return. “I will do what I can, and am asked of, as the party chairman,” Lee said, after having lunch with Kim. “We did not even discuss (a return). I have known Kim for nearly 10 years. We know each other well enough that we don’t have to share words.”Kim also met Yoon at the party’s headquarters in Yeouido, western Seoul, and agreed to a plan where Kim is to take stronger control of the election committee. “As a person responsible for the committee, I will take the lead so that a crisis like this would not happen again,” Kim told reporters. There have been speculations that Kim, who belatedly joined the election committee, would try to reorganize the group, as Lee has paved the way for Kim to proceed with a reshuffle through his resignation. “It is true that the committee is inefficient due to its enormous size. We will look at how to make things more efficient in detail,” Kim said. Yoon also said he will support Kim in taking lead of the election committee. “Kim said he will tighten his grip on the committee for it to be run more efficiently. I also asked Kim (to take a stronger lead),” Yoon said.When asked about whether he would meet with Lee, the candidate did not answer. Lee announced his resignation from the election committee Tuesday following an argument with Cho. Cho also resigned from her post, apologizing to Lee. The conflict comes less than a month after the party fell into crisis when Lee and Yoon were at odds over the election committee.By Im Eun-byel (silverstar@heraldcorp.com)Another figure in land development scandal dies	Published : Dec 22, 2021 - 17:13 Updated : Dec 23, 2021 - 09:08
A second key figure in the Daejang-dong land development scandal has been found dead, 11 days after another key figure also died.The deceased, Seongnam Development Corp.’s development chief Kim Moon-ki, was among those prosecutors were questioning as part of their investigation into the development project, which took place while now-presidential candidate Lee Jae-myeong was mayor of the city. On Tuesday, police said they discovered Kim’s body in an office of the company in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, at around 8:30 p.m. His family reported him missing at 8:13 p.m.Earlier this month, Yoo Han-gi, head of Pocheon Urban Corp. took his own life after prosecutors requested an arrest warrant against him for allegedly accepting a bribe of 200 million won ($167,000) in exchange for favors for key partners of the land development project. Yoo was Kim’s senior manager at Seongnam Development Corp. when the project was carried out. Prosecutors had questioned Kim on allegations he turned a blind eye to the request to include a clause from the project contract that would allow the city government to recoup excessive profits made by private investors in the development project. Kim and Yoo were also among the three judges who took part in the evaluations to decide on the preferred bidder of private companies for the land development project. With the other judge, Jung Min-yong, who was the chief of the company’s strategy and business bureau at the time, Kim was found to have “unfairly” given high scores to the Hana Bank consortium that Hwacheon Daeyu was participating in -- aiding the consortium to win a contract in the development project. Hwacheon Daeyu is the asset management firm at the center of controversy for reaping enormous profit from the land development. Jung was indicted without detention Tuesday on charges including dereliction of duty and money laundering. Following the deaths of the key officials in the land development project, political parties reiterated their calls to conduct a special probe with an independent counsel into the corruption scandal Wednesday. A special probe with an independent counsel can take place after a bill passes the National Assembly, or when the justice minister finds the need for a probe into the case. Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea who the main opposition alleges to be the mastermind behind the Daejang-dong development scandal, said he has already asked for a special probe into the case“I have already requested a parliamentary proposal for a special probe (into the case). I have not changed my stance that it is right to clarify the truth in the case, and have those responsible accept liability,” Lee said attending a ceremony in Seoul.The main opposition People Power Party also called for an independent counsel to probe Lee’s involvement in the corruption case, as he was the mayor of Seongnam when the city’s land development project took place. In a separate interview, Lee also said, “It is better if the case is clarified.” “It may be too raw to put it this way, but (the scandal) is driving me crazy,” Lee added, when asked of his thoughts on his involvement accusation. “Kim Moon-ki was the key person to tell us who ordered the removal of the critical clause on recouping excessive profit of private companies,” Kim Jin-tae, who heads the opposition party’s special committee on vetting Lee Jae-myung, said, visiting the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Wednesday. “There are so few people left who know the truth and we don’t know what other unfortunate events may occur,” Kim added, urging for the launch of a special probe into the case.

Former President Park Geun-hye is to be pardoned in the special New Year presidential pardon granted to 3,094 individuals. Former President Lee Myung-bak was not included in the list. Park, 69, has been serving a combined 22-year term since March 2017 for charges including abuse of power and bribery, after she was impeached in the year before. Her immediate predecessor Lee, who is currently serving a 17-year prison sentence for bribery and embezzlement, has not been given the special pardon. “We should overcome the pain of the past era and move forward into a new era. Instead of being trapped in the past and fighting each other, we should gather forces to move onto the future,” President Moon Jae-in said in a statement, after the Justice Ministry released the list of special pardons. “(On Park’s pardon) we also considered Park‘s deteriorating health,” Moon added and asked for understanding from those who oppose the decision. Park was hospitalized three times due to chronic shoulder and lower back pain. She also received shoulder surgery in 2019. Following the announcement, Park expressed gratitude to Moon via her lawyer Yoo Young-ha.“I would like to first apolgize to the people for causing worries, and I am grateful for unwavering support,” Park said in the message delivered by Yoo who met with reporters outside the Samsung Seoul Hospital in Seoul, where she has been admitted. “I also want to express my deep gratitude to President Moon Jae-in and the government for granting the special pardon. I will do my best to recover soon so that I can express my gratitude to the people myself.”The pardon, which is set to take effect from Dec. 31, also includes reinstatement of former Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook, who was imprisoned from 2015 to 2017 for taking some 900 million won ($750,000) of illegal political funds. Han served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 under the Roh Moo-hyun administration, and was later leader of a predecessor to the ruling party. The list also includes 38 entrepreneurs and small business operators, two political and labor activists, as well as reinstatement of one person who has been charged for illegal abortion.The government also gave a special reduction in punisment to 983,051 people, all but 2,271 of whom had received driver’s license suspensions. The Justice Ministry said it decided on the special pardon to relieve the burden for the people experiencing difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote unity in society.
